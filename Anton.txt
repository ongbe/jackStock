I thought I'd chime in. I actually joined this forum because 
I was curious what others had to say about the program now that I have finished it.

First, my background is similar to Anton but in a different capacity. 
I went to go and work in NYC on the sell side and spent time with a mutual fund company and then transitioned into I-banking.

I have a decent understanding of the economy, markets, products, their functions etc. 
While I have taken many courses and have practiced professionally after my years on the sell side, 
my experience is more on the retail banking side.

Anyway. I have traded for about 10 years or so with mixed results. Overall I have been profitable however 
I have experienced huge swings and difficult emotional and financial times as a result. 
Again, I've always had good income from work as well as enough experience to fix 
my mistakes without blowing out my account.

I met Anton through a friend who knew him in NYC and I was very impressed with his personality. 
A lot of the local clubs or trading gurus here in Canada run a similar story of 
unrealistic get wealthy quick or day trading promotion. Not realistic at all.

I took Anton's course and I would say that compared with any of the other trading 
education/seminars etc out there, this one is the best. I've never taken other 
courses however know of people who have and they shared their experiences with me. 
I will give you the straight goods.

Anton is actually a nice guy but he's type-A and likes to be in the lime-light. 
I think that's obvious from his TV gig and his trading in space plan. 
It's nothing bad but it's just who he is. Part of why he teaches is because he likes it. 
He likes teaching, holding these seminars and it's a way to have a level of fame.

Why does this matter? I think a lot of people say if he was a good trader then why bother or 
if he has to teach it means he can't do it. I think if he had a billion dollars he'd do something 
like this anyway. He just likes being the center of attention. He also believes in what he is 
doing and he likes being the one guy who is willing to tell people how it is. 
He's the only person who's honest about trading that I've ever met in that environment.

His course is very much NOT like a lot of other courses. 
Anton is pretty clear from the get-go that day trading isn't really a good idea 
in most cases and that the highly directional trades that most 
people make are dangerous. He focuses on capital preservation and managing risk.

I've sat in on free seminars and you have some clown at the front showing how their 
student turned $2000 into $750,000 in a year. That's just not realistic and it's 
scary that people buy into that. Anton is quick to tell you that trading is 
not glamorous, it is not easy, and it's not going to happen quickly. 
He is also up front that this is not some kind of trade 
from home and replace your income strategy.

In fact, he's pretty much spot on with how he does things.

The sad thing is that some of his stuff is somewhat sales-like 
because people want to be sold the sizzle. That said, his 
material is all about Macro, top down, detailed research, 
and very little TA and mid term trading windows with risk management.

Not just risk management such as stops and ratios but 
building your trades so that you are protected 
(long shorts etc) options etc.

His view of cash management and knowing what you're doing is very valuable. 
At any moment his questions are what's your risk in this trade, 
exposure, etc and it is constantly in view. 
The view is all about protecting your money while 
taking advantage of opportunities while protecting your cash.

You won't double your money every year with Anton, but you won't 
blow your account out either.

Again, I came into this very differently than most. I have a CFA, 
I know a lot about the background required to make trades and industry exposure. 
I've traded successfully and paying the money was less than a weeks worth of pay after taxes.

Do I recommend it? Yes and no.
It's the real deal but it's also a lot of work. I'd say if you're not already very well 
familiarized with the industry and trading it will be a lot to take in and actually apply. 
I think if you're a truck driver and you want to start trading, 
taking Anton's course will be way over your head. 
Yes, you'll get through it but your ability to apply 
it will likely not work. Again, not because of the course, 
but because thinking like a trader isn't an overnight process.

I purchased the lifetime membership and it was worth it for me. 
Did it make me a better trader? Yes for sure. It gave me a different 
way to look at how I trade and I laugh at how I used to trade compared to now. 
There are some obvious things that helped me to reduce risk. 
I'm more comfortable taking on riskier high payoff positions 
now because I'm able to hedge my bets more effectively.

Like everything, there will be people that say Anton is a scam or he's a douche 
or whatever and to some people maybe he is kind of a douche. 
That said what do you expect? Most of the people thinking about taking a trading 
course are looking to trade to make lots of money and want to live some kind of 
lifestyle with freedom or fast cars or woman etc.

The financial world, let's face it, is about greed and I think anyone calling 
someone out in trading is a bit of the pot calling the kettle black.

Again, this is just my opinion but he is legit for sure and he's not 
going to promise the same trash a lot of these other places talk about.

Hi All,

A. Anton Kreil ITPM Course

I have bought AK course for USD1500 2months ago, due to limited financial resources, after paying high Uni fees as well as not getting a job. End of the day, I think for the Uni fees that I have paid USD1,500 (equi to Â£1,000) would not hurt much, if I can learn something.

After the Video, I felt apart from the correct approach he teach (Top Down, Bottom Up, Risk Management, Watch List)... this approach is all fine and well.


The next thing, I am a bit concerned:
1. Signing up with ITPM with Saxo (this concern me, ie Conflict of Interest that AK pitch). Essentially, every trade that I do, I will contribute a commission to AK, as ITPM essentially becomes "Introductory Broker"???
2. Apart from the right approach, the trades that gears us into the Trading Account is CFD trading, using leverage. This also mean that the wider our Pairs Trading, the more AK will get out from the Institute Traders

From the above, how are we considering the AK course v "conflict of interest"???

B. Lex Van Dam Trading Academy

If you now compare (A) and (B), you will now see that if we learn the right stuff from Lex, Lex is not benefiting from any Trading Commission... because Lex is only selling his course, and that's the end of the story, nothing more...

At this moment, I need to hear from you guys of your thoughts to give some opinion of the situations and scenario.

Appreciate your feedback...

====================
i went to one of his seminars a couple of years ago.hes a nice enough chap and may well have worked for some large companies but i dont think his approach is geared to day trading and his concepts perhaps you could apply if you had a million and split it between 20 or more stocks which would be his (the)hedge fund way of doing things as he thinks a spread better would blow it all on one trade.then theres one of his poor chaps that does morning/afternoon/closing reviews,this was up x % this was down y%........which seems alot of pointless number crunching,i doubt it leaves him any time to actually trade.on a recent video of his 'trading the truth' ive seen him say a hedge fund player will start with 100m and turn it into 7billion in 7 years and walk away with 500m.does he realise thats a return of 100% year on year,is it even possible,and if it was why would you want to walk away,would you not stick around to be the richest person in the cosmos.
but like all seminars with something to sell they are filled with some facts,basic truths,things you can buy into and then you have to pay to buy into further.
being relatively new to trading,one thing new i was introduced to and took away with me was the vix,which i now keep an eye on.ive been to two other seminars,from one i took away the idea of divergence and from the other SAR.
being a newbie i thought theres got to be something im missing and looked outwards for and these seminars/webinars perhaps held the key.all in all,they were nice days out in london but i dont think id be paying for them,especially not thousands.
just my thoughts. 

=======================

Ive got his course, basically its a recording of a free lecture he gave at city university . Bundled it up in a nice package and decent marketing and call it a trading course

Its all fundamental analysis, that too not going into detail just basic stuff like what is GDP, what is ISM number and what to look for etc , Doesn't go into depth on how to make those decisions or any such thing, Stuff you can get form economics 101 if you took it
